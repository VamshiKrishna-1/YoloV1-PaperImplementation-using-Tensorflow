## Overview
This project ambitiously implements YOLOv1, a revolutionary real-time object detection algorithm, using TensorFlow from scratch. The main goal is to understand and replicate the performance of YOLOv1, making it accessible and easy to use for real-world applications.

## Key Features
* Speed and Accuracy: Real-time object detection with high precision.
* Grid-based Detection: Simultaneous object localization and classification.
* Custom TensorFlow Implementation: A from-scratch coding adventure.

## Project Structure
* model.py: The heart of the project - YOLOv1 model architecture.
* utils.py: Utility belt - data preprocessing, bbox utilities, and more.
* train.py: Ready, Set, Train!
* loss.py: Loss function is defined for YoloV1.
* test.py: Test the waters - how good is your model?
* dataset.py: Streamling the data into batches.

## Implementation Details
YOLOv1â€™s potential is tapped into with a tailor-made architecture, optimized for a balance between speed and accuracy, and tested against a variety of use-cases. With extensive data augmentation and IoU metric, we ensure robust performance and reliable bounding box predictions.

## Getting Started
Dependencies - Tensorflow - 2.1, numpy, os, pandas, Open-cv, matplotlib, PIL
