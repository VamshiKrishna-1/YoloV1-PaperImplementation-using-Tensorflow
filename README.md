Overview
This project ambitiously implements YOLOv1, a revolutionary real-time object detection algorithm, using TensorFlow from scratch. The main goal is to understand and replicate the performance of YOLOv1, making it accessible and easy to use for real-world applications.

Key Features
Speed and Accuracy: Real-time object detection with high precision.
Grid-based Detection: Simultaneous object localization and classification.
Custom TensorFlow Implementation: A from-scratch coding adventure.
Project Structure
model/: The heart of the project - YOLOv1 model architecture.
data/: Home for the dataset, train-test splits, and all things data.
scripts/: Scripts to make life easy - training, testing, and demo.
utils/: Utility belt - data preprocessing, bbox utilities, and more.
weights/: Where the trained muscles of our model live.
config.py: Central command - tweak hyperparameters to your heart‚Äôs content.
train.py: Ready, Set, Train!
evaluate.py: Test the waters - how good is your model?
demo.py: See the magic happen - run object detection on images/videos.
Implementation Details
YOLOv1‚Äôs potential is tapped into with a tailor-made architecture, optimized for a balance between speed and accuracy, and tested against a variety of use-cases. With extensive data augmentation and IoU metric, we ensure robust performance and reliable bounding box predictions.

Getting Started
Jump into the INSTALL.md for a guided setup. Once you‚Äôre all set, train.py kicks off your training adventure, and evaluate.py lets you see how well you did.

Usage Examples
Peek into demo.py for a practical magic show - watch as images and videos transform with real-time object detection.
